Main difference between descriptive and inferential statistics

Deferential Stats is used to decribe the data in form of visualizations where as inferential statistics uses same data to conclude from it
For eg. 100 people from Jaipur is asked "Is Xavier's still worthy school" people will anwer in yes or no.

we can either plot these yes or no in form of bar graph or pie chart or else we can say that some 'x' percentage of people think that Xavier's is worthy this is inferential stats
